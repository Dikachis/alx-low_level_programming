# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
## Objectives
* To learn pointers to pointers and how to use them
* To learn multidimensional arrays and how to use them
## General Requirement
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
## Files to be worked on:

  2.	1-memcpy.c		a function that copies memory area.
  3.	2-strchr.c		a function that locates a character in a string.
  4.	3-strspn.c		a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
  5.	4-strpbrk.c		a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
  6.	5-strstr.c	 	a function that locates a substring.
  7.	7-print_chessboard.c	a function that prints the chessboard.
