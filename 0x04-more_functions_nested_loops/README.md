# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
how to write a function that prints program
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include.

### General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file.

## Files to be work on includea:
* 0-isupper.c
* 1-isdigit.c
* 2-mul.c
* 3-print_numbers.c
* 4-print_most_numbers.c
* 5-more_numbers.c
* 6-print_line.c
* 7-print_diagonal.c
* and more...
