This is the continuetion of 0x05. C - pointers, arrays and strings...

## Objectives:
To write a function to demonstrate pointers, arrays and strings using the function prototypes.

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file

## The files worked on are:
* 0-strcat.c
* 1-strncat.c
* 2-strncpy.c
* 3-strcmp.c
* 4-rev_array.c
* 5-string_toupper.c
* 6-cap_string.c
