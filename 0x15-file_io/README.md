# 0x15. C - File I/O

## Resources to read or watch:
* [File descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor)
* [C Programming in Linux Tutorial #024 - open() read() write() Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP3N8g7h8gY) | [Intranet](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/9Tmu01qEnA9q9khz3gqzJQ)

### man or help:
**open**, **close**, **read**, **write**, **dprintf**

## Introduction/Objective
* To look for the right source of information online
* To know how to create, open, close, read and write files
* To know what file descriptors are
* To know what the 3 standard file descriptors are, their purpose and their **POSIX** names
* To know how to use the I/O system calls **open**, **close**, **read** and **write**
* To know what the flags, **O_RDONLY**, **O_WRONLY**, **O_RDWR** are, and how to use them
* To know what are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the **open** system call
* To know what a system call is
* To know what the difference between a function and a system call

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* Allowed syscalls: **read**, **write**, **open**, **close**
* All files is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc**, using the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89**
* All files ends with a new line
* No more than 5 functions per file
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are compiled using the **Betty style**
* The only C standard library functions allowed are **malloc**, **free** and **exit**.
* Also allowed to use **_putchar**
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function **_putchar** should be included in your header file called **main.h**
* All header files were include guarded
* Tip: Symbolic constants **(POSIX)** vs numbers where used. For instance **read(STDIN_FILENO, ...** vs **read(0, ...**
