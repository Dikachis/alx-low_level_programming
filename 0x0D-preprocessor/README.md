# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
## Introduction/Objective
* To know what macros are, and how to use them
* To know the most common predefined macros
* To know how to include guard your header files

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc**, using the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89**
* All files ends with a new line
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are compiled using the **Betty style**
* C standard library functions; malloc, free and exit are allowed. But, the functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* All header files were include guarded

## List of files required and more:
| S/N   |       files          |        Description  |
|:-----:|:--------------------:|:-------------------|
|  1.   | [0-object_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Dikachis/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h) |A header file that defines a macro named **SIZE** as an abbreviation for the token **1024**.  |
|  2.   |[1-pi.h](https://github.com/Dikachis/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h) | A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token **3.14159265359.**  |
|  3.   |[2-main.c](https://github.com/Dikachis/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.h) |A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.|
|  4.   |[3-function_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Dikachis/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h) | A function-like macro **ABS(x)** that computes the absolute value of a number **x**.|
|  5.   |[4-sum.h](https://github.com/Dikachis/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h) | A function-like macro **SUM(x, y)** that computes the sum of the numbers **x** and **y**.|
