# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives<br>
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: ``vi``, ``vim``, ``emacs``
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files end with a new line
- Your code should use the ``Betty`` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the ``printf`` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like ``strdup``, ``malloc``, … is forbidden.
- There is ``test`` folder which contains the ``main.c`` files. You can use them to test your functions.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called ``search_algos.h``
- All your header files should be include guarded

### More Info
**You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:**
- ``O(1)``
- ``O(n)``
- ``O(n!)``
- n*m -> ``O(nm)``
- n square -> ``O(n^2)``
- sqrt n -> ``O(sqrt(n))``
- log(n) -> ``O(log(n))``
- n * log(n) -> ``O(nlog(n))``
- …
