# 0x0A. C - argc, argv
## Introduction/Objective
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* The different prototypes for **main** you know and when to use them
* How to use **__attribute__((unused)) or (void)** to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files ends with a new line
* There is a README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are compiled using the Betty style
* The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function **_putchar** are included in the header file **main.h**
* The standard library is allowed.
