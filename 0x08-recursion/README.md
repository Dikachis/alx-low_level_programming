# 0x08. C - Recursion
## Objectives
* What recursion is
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
## General Requirement
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
* You are not allowed to use static variables
## Files to be worked on:
###     S/N     	Files                   	Description
        1.      0-puts_recursion.c              function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
        2.      1-print_rev_recursion.c         function that prints a string in reverse.
        3.      2-strlen_recursion.c            function that returns the length of a string.
        4.      3-factorial.c              	function that returns the factorial of a given number.
        5.      4-pow_recursion.c          	function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
        6.      5-sqrt_recursion.c     		function that returns the natural square root of a number.
        7.      6-is_prime_number.c    		function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns 0.
        8.      7-is_palindrome.c      		function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
	9.	100-wildcmp.c			function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0.
